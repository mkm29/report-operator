# report-operator

This operator simply watched for `VulnerabilityReport` CRDs (already created by the `trivy` operator) and uploads all reports to an S3 bucket.

## Description

Because this relies on CRDs already provided by Aqua Security, no need to define/install them here. You need to first install the `trivy-operator`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator). Once the `trivy-operator` is installed, you can install this operator. 

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Follow instructions for installing CRDs from `trivy-operator`.
2. Please take a look at the `build-and-deploy.sh` shell script and modify the variables as needed:
    * `IMAGE_NAME` - the name of the image to be built and deployed
    * `IMAGE_TAG` - the tag to use for the image
    * `NAMESPACE` - the namespace to deploy the operator to
    * `S3_BUCKET` - the S3 bucket to upload reports to
    * The below are optional, if not specified will default to environment variables
    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - the AWS access key ID to use
    * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - the AWS secret access key to use
    * `AWS_REGION` - the AWS region to use
3. This script will automate all steps for you, including building the image, pushing it to a registry, and deploying the operator to the cluster. You can run it with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./build-and-deploy.sh
    ```

  * If using ECR, please uncomment `make ecr-login` line in the script.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 


### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

### Modify CRD

You must add the `processed` boolean to the `VulnerabilityReport` CRD. This is used to determine if the report has already been processed or not.

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
  ...
  - description: Has report been processed
    name: processed
    jsonPath: .report.processed
    priority: 1
    type: boolean
  schema.properties.report:
    ...
    processed:
      description: Whether the report been processed and uploaded to S3
      type: boolean
```

For this either perform:

* `kubectl edit crd/vulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io`
* `kubectl patch`
* Kustomize:
  * Edit `config/crd/bases/aquasecurity.github.io_vulnerabilityreports.yaml`
  * Run `make manifests`
  * `kubectl apply -f config/crd/aquasecurity.github.io_vulnerabilityreports.yaml`.

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
